# DEQProject
A script to help complete a project on numerical approximation methods in MATH 228 at CWRU.
Later modified to use as a project in CSDS 297.

## Files
* **DEQProject.js** - original script used to complete the MATH 228 project, focused in a single ODE with specific initial conditions.
* **test.js** - script to debug a specific case in the MATH 228 problem, where the numerical methods failed for technical reasons.
* **main.js** - Edited script to take user input for initial conditions - ODE is still hardcoded.
